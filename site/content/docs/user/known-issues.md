Having problems with kind? This guide is covers some known problems and solutions / workarounds.

It may additionally be helpful to:

- check our [issue tracker]
- [file an issue][file an issue] (if there isn't one already)
- reach out and ask for help in [#kind] on the [kubernetes slack]

## Failures involving mistmatched kubectl versions

`kind` will fail create a cluster, if the version of Kubernetes for the client and server differ.

This is a issue that frequently occurs when running `kind` alongside Docker For Mac.

This problem is related to a bug in [docker on macOS][for-mac#3663]

If you see something like the following error message:
```bash
kubectl edit deploy -n kube-system kubernetes-dashboard
error: SchemaError(io.k8s.api.autoscaling.v2beta1.ExternalMetricStatus): invalid object doesn't have additional properties
```

You can check your client and server versions by running:
```bash
kubectl version
```

If there is a mismatch between the server and client versions, you should install a newer client version. 

If you are using Mac, you can install kubectl via homebrew by running:
```bash
brew install kubernetes-cli
```

And overwrite the symlinks created by Docker For Mac by running:
```bash
brew link --overwrite kubernetes-cli
```

[for-mac#3663]: https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3663

## Docker on Btrfs

`kind` cannot run properly if containers on your machine / host are backed by a
[Btrfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) filesystem.

This should only be relevant on Linux, on which you can check with:

```
docker info | grep -i storage
```

As a workaround, create the following configuration in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

After restarting the Docker daemon you should see that Docker is now using the `overlay2` storage driver instead of `btrfs`.

### Docker Installed with Snap

If you installed Docker with [snap], it is likely that `docker` commands do not
have access to `$TMPDIR`. This may break some kind commands which depend
on using temp directories (`kind build ...`).

Currently a workaround for this is setting the `TEMPDIR` environment variable to
a directory snap does have access to when working with kind.
This can for example be some directory under `$HOME`.

## Failing to apply overlay network
There are two known causes for problems while applying the overlay network
while building a kind cluster:

* Host machine is behind a proxy
* Usage of Docker version 18.09

If you see something like the following error message:
```
 ‚úó [kind-1-control-plane] Starting Kubernetes (this may take a minute) ‚ò∏
FATA[07:20:43] Failed to create cluster: failed to apply overlay network: exit status 1
```

or the following, when setting the `loglevel` flag to debug,
```
DEBU[16:26:53] Running: /usr/bin/docker [docker exec --privileged kind-1-control-plane /bin/sh -c kubectl apply --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf | base64 | tr -d '\n')"]
ERRO[16:28:25] failed to apply overlay network: exit status 1 ) ‚ò∏
 ‚úó [control-plane] Starting Kubernetes (this may take a minute) ‚ò∏

DEBU[16:28:25] Running: /usr/bin/docker [docker rm -f -v kind-1-control-plane]
‚†à‚†Å [control-plane] Pre-loading images üêã Error: failed to create cluster: failed to apply overlay network: exit status 1
```

The issue may be due to your host machine being behind a proxy, such as in
[kind#136][kind#136].
We are currently looking into ways of mitigating this issue by preloading CNI
artifacts, see [kind#200][kind#200].
Another possible solution is to enable kind nodes to use a proxy when
downloading images, see [kind#270][kind#270].

The last known case for this issue comes from the host machine 
[using Docker 18.09 in kind#136][kind#136-docker]. 
In this case, a known solution is to upgrade to any Docker version greater than or
equal to Docker 18.09.1.


## Failure to build node image
Building kind's node image may fail due to running out of memory on Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows.
See [kind#229][kind#229].

If you see something like this:

Then you may try increasing the resource limits for the Docker engine on Mac or Windows.

It is recommended that you allocate at least 8GB of RAM to build Kubernetes.

Open the **Preferences** menu.

<img src="/docs/user/images/docker-pref-1.png"/>

Go to the **Advanced** settings page, and change the settings there, see 
[changing Docker's resource limits][Docker resource lims].

<img width="400px" src="/docs/user/images/docker-pref-build.png" alt="Setting 8Gb of memory in Docker for Mac" />

<img width="400px" src="/docs/user/images/docker-pref-build-win.png" alt="Setting 8Gb of memory in Docker for Windows" />

## Failing to properly start cluster
This issue is similar to a 
[failure while building the node image](#failure-to-build-node-image).
If the cluster creation process was successful but you are unable to see any
Kubernetes resources running, for example:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
c0261f7512fd        kindest/node:v1.12.2   "/usr/local/bin/entr‚Ä¶"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:64907->64907/tcp   kind-1-control-plane
$ docker exec -it c0261f7512fd /bin/sh
# docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
#
```

or `kubectl` being unable to connect to the cluster,
```
$ export KUBECONFIG="$(kind get kubeconfig-path)"
$ kubectl cluster-info

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
Unable to connect to the server: EOF
```

Then as in [kind#156][kind#156], you may solve this issue by claiming back some
space on your machine by removing unused data or images left by the Docker 
engine by running:
```
docker system prune
```

and / or:
```
docker image prune
```

You can verify the issue by exporting the logs (`kind export logs`) and looking
at the kubelet logs, which may have something like the following:
```
Dec 07 00:37:53 kind-1-control-plane kubelet[688]: I1207 00:37:53.229561     688 eviction_manager.go:340] eviction manager: must evict pod(s) to reclaim ephemeral-storage
Dec 07 00:37:53 kind-1-control-plane kubelet[688]: E1207 00:37:53.229638     688 eviction_manager.go:351] eviction manager: eviction thresholds have been met, but no pods are active to evict
```

If on the other hand you are running kind on a btrfs partition and your logs
show something like the following:
```
an 03 17:42:41 kind-1-control-plane kubelet[3804]: F0103 17:42:41.470269 3804 kubelet.go:1359] Failed to start ContainerManager failed to get rootfs info: failed to get device for dir "/ var/lib/kubelet": could not find device with major: 0, minor: 67 in cached partitions map
```

This problem seems to be related to a [bug in Docker][moby#9939].

## Docker permission denied

When using `kind`, we assume that the user you are executing kind as has permission to use docker.
If you initially ran Docker CLI commands using `sudo`, you may see the following error, which indicates that your `~/.docker/` directory was created with incorrect permissions due to the `sudo` commands.

```
WARNING: Error loading config file: /home/user/.docker/config.json
open /home/user/.docker/config.json: permission denied
```

To fix this problem, either follow the docker's docs [manage docker as a non root user][manage docker as a non root user],
or try to use `sudo` before your commands (if you get `command not found` please check [this comment about sudo with kind][sudo with kind]).

## Docker on Windows

[Docker Desktop for Windows][docker desktop for windows] supports running both Linux (the default) and Windows Docker containers.

`kind` for Windows requires Linux containers. To switch between Linux and Windows containers see [this page][switch between windows and linux containers].
